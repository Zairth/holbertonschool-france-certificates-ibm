## 🌩️ IBM Introduction to Cloud Computing Certificate

I am proud to have earned the **IBM Introduction to Cloud Computing Certificate** as part of my curriculum at **Holberton School**. This certification highlights my foundational knowledge of cloud computing and its essential role in today’s digital landscape.

### 📌 Why Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations manage, store, and access data. From **on-demand resources** to **cost-efficient scalability**, cloud services are at the core of digital transformation. Understanding the basics of cloud infrastructure is a critical step for any aspiring developer, DevOps engineer, or IT professional.

### 🚀 My Cloud Learning Journey

Throughout this course, I’ve explored the following topics:
- Core **concepts and terminologies** of cloud computing  
- The **history and evolution** of cloud technology  
- **Deployment models**: public, private, hybrid, and community clouds  
- **Virtualization** and its role in cloud infrastructure  
- Types of **cloud storage and services** (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

This course provided a strong theoretical base to help me confidently approach more complex cloud environments in the future.

## 🛡️ IBM Cybersecurity Fundamentals Certificate

In addition, I am proud to have earned the **IBM Cybersecurity Fundamentals Certificate**, reinforcing my understanding of security principles and the threats faced in today’s interconnected world.

### 📌 Why Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is essential for safeguarding data, systems, and infrastructure. As digital threats evolve, developers and organizations must stay ahead by understanding **threat models**, **attack vectors**, and **defensive strategies**. This certificate helped me build that necessary foundation.

### 🔐 My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

This course introduced me to:
- Different **cyber threat groups** and their motivations  
- Common **types of cyberattacks** like malware, phishing, and ransomware  
- **Social engineering** techniques and how they manipulate human behavior  
- Real-world **case studies** of cybersecurity incidents  
- Global **risk management** and incident response strategies  
- Principles of **cryptography** for protecting data  
- Organizational **best practices** for prevention, detection, and response  

This learning path gave me a practical and conceptual framework to think like a defender and understand vulnerabilities in systems and human processes.

### 📄 Certificate
