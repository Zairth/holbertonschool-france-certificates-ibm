## IBM SQL Certificate

I am proud to have earned the **IBM SQL Certificate** as part of my learning journey at **Holberton School**. This certificate acknowledges my understanding and practical knowledge of **Structured Query Language (SQL)** and database management principles.

### Why SQL?

SQL is a fundamental skill for anyone working with data. It allows for efficient querying, manipulation, and management of relational databases. Mastering SQL enables me to extract meaningful insights from data, optimize database performance, and build robust applications.

### My SQL Learning Journey

As part of my curriculum at **Holberton School**, I have worked on various SQL projects that have helped me:
- Write complex **SQL queries** to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Understand **database normalization** and optimization techniques.
- Work with **joins, subqueries, indexes, and stored procedures**.
- Design and manage relational database schemas.

This certificate represents my ability to work with SQL databases effectively and efficiently.

### What's Next?

I am eager to continue refining my SQL skills, explore advanced topics like **performance tuning**, **big data integration**, and **NoSQL databases**, and apply my knowledge to real-world data-driven applications.

## IBM SQLi Guardium Certificate

I am proud to have earned the **IBM SQLi Guardium Certificate**, which recognizes my expertise in SQL security and database protection using **IBM Guardium**.

### Why SQL Security & IBM Guardium?

With the increasing reliance on data, database security has become more critical than ever. SQL injection (SQLi) attacks are one of the most common threats to databases. IBM Guardium provides **real-time monitoring, threat detection, and compliance automation** to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches.

### My SQL Security Learning Journey

Through my studies, I have gained expertise in:
- **Identifying and mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities**.
- Implementing **access control, encryption, and auditing** for database security.
- Using **IBM Guardium** for real-time monitoring and threat detection.
- Understanding **compliance frameworks** such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

### Certificate

You can view my **IBM SQLi Guardium Certificate** below:

This certificate demonstrates my commitment to securing databases and applying best practices in SQL security.

### What's Next?

I am excited to further explore **cybersecurity in databases**, learn about **ethical hacking**, and implement **advanced security measures** to protect data assets in modern IT infrastructures.
